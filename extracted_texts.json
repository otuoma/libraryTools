We encounter  \ncustomers and business partners who display diffe ring lifestyles, norms, and con sumption \nbehaviors. These differences influence all dimensions  of international business. Often, they \nget in the way of straightforward communication, representing one of  the four risks \nassociated with international business that we introduced in Cross -cultural risk  is defined as a \nsituation or  event where a cultural  miscommunication puts some human value at stake.  \nCross -cultural risk arises routinely in international business because of the  diverse cultural \nheritage of the participants.  \n \nCulture  refers to the learned, shared,  and enduring orientation patterns in a s ociety. People \ndemonstrate their culture  through values, ideas, attitudes, behaviors, and symbols.  Culture \naffects even simple greetings and partings. Greeting ceremonies are  a deeply embedded \ncultural marker and evolve over many centuries. They  specify su ch behaviors as how far \napart to stand, what to say, and whether or  not to touch or smile. The ceremonies may vary as \na function of the age, gender,  or status of the greeters. What people say in greeting each other \nalso varies. For  example, in China, frien ds express thoughtfulness by asking each other  \nwhether they have had their meal yet. In Turkey, a typical greeting is “What is  new with \nyou?” When meeting a person for the first time, the common questions “Where in the \ncountry do you come from?” in an effo rt to establish some  commonality with the other party. \nThe Japanese, who still exercise formal  greeting and parting rituals, routinely apologize to \nthe other party just before  ending a telephone conversation.  Unlike political, legal, and \neconomic systems, culture has proven very difficult to identify and analyze. Its effects on \ninternational business are deep and  broad.  \n \nQ.1. In cross -cultural business customers and business partners display diffe ring lifestyles,  \n        norms, and con sumption behaviors.  Explain  the influences of these behaviours ? \n           (15 Marks)"

In the early days the five \nfounders reveled  in spending time together, brainstorming ideas to come up with the best \npossible solutions for clients. Today, while they still work well together, drawing on one \nanother’s strengths, their roles have changed as the business has grown. Status is now consi dered \nto be a medium -sized consulting firm, employing 115 consultants who are organized  into \ndivisions of 10 to 15 people under the management of a divisional leader.  \nIt has come time for staff bonuses to be paid at Status and Sue Jackson, the divisional l eader of \nthe Technology Services Division (TSD) division, is faced with a dilemma of what to do with \none of her “high -flying loners”. Daniel Brook is an incredibly driven, highly motivated \nindividual who had been recruited to Status 6 months ago after rece iving his Masters in \nInformation Technology at a local university (with distinction). The Managing Director of Status \nhad personally interviewed Brook, and had immediately recruited him sighting him as an \n“exceptional talent”."
